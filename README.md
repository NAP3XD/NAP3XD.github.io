# 👋 Hi, I'm Nicholas Pratt

I'm a senior Computer Science student at UNC Charlotte, focusing on **cybersecurity** and **data-driven systems**. Over the summer, I earned my **CCNA certification**, which strengthened my networking and systems foundation.  

Outside the classroom, I enjoy **skateboarding**, spending time with my **17-month-old son**, and hanging out with my **Rottweiler**. I'm also passionate about exploring how technology can be applied to real-world problems—from smart IoT projects to studying the impact of **data mining** in areas like addiction recovery and decision-making.

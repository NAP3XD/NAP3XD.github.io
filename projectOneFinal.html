      <h2>Introduce the problem</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Unlike conditions that are strictly genetic, many of the risk factors for CVD are modifiable lifestyle choices. Behaviors such as diet, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and physical activity have long been tied to cardiovascular health outcomes. Younger adults often underestimate these risks, assuming that disease only comes later in life, but global health data shows that non-communicable diseases affect all age groups and account for nearly 70% of worldwide deaths.</p>
        <p>The aim of this project is to investigate lifestyle choices and their relationship with cardiovascular disease outcomes in a large patient dataset. Specifically, I was interested in alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity, as these behaviors are directly modifiable and have been highlighted as important factors in CVD prevention.</p>
      </div>

    <section id="intro-data">
      <h2>Introduce the data</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The dataset comes from the Kaggle <em>Cardiovascular Disease Dataset</em>. It contains 70,000 patient records with demographic, clinical, and lifestyle measures. Each row represents one patient, and the target variable <code>cardio</code> indicates whether that individual has cardiovascular disease (1 = present, 0 = absent).</p>
        <p>The dataset includes demographic features such as age (recorded in days rather than years), gender, height (cm), and weight (kg). Clinical measures include systolic blood pressure (<code>ap_hi</code>), diastolic blood pressure (<code>ap_lo</code>), cholesterol, and glucose levels that are categorized as 1 (normal), 2 (above normal), or 3 (well above normal). Lifestyle behaviors are represented by binary flags: <code>smoke</code>, <code>alco</code>, and <code>active</code>. The target column <code>cardio</code> completes the dataset.</p>
        <p>This structure makes the dataset appealing for exploratory data analysis and classification. Its blend of numerical, categorical, and binary features allows for investigation of both clinical and lifestyle predictors of CVD.</p>

    <section id="preprocessing">
      <h2>Pre-processing the data</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Although the dataset contained no missing values, several steps were needed to improve interpretability and ensure biological plausibility.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Convert age from days to years:</strong> Since age was stored in days, dividing by 365.25 gave a clinically meaningful measure that could be interpreted in the context of population health.</li>
          <li><strong>Create Body Mass Index (BMI):</strong> Using weight and height, I calculated BMI to provide a normalized measure of body composition. BMI is widely used in health research as an indicator of overweight and obesity, both of which are risk factors for CVD.</li>
          <li><strong>Create pulse pressure:</strong> Defined as systolic minus diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure is a marker of arterial stiffness and has known associations with cardiovascular outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Filter implausible values:</strong> Records with unrealistic measures (e.g., height &lt;130 cm, weight &lt;35 kg, systolic &lt;80 mmHg, diastolic &lt;40 mmHg, negative pulse pressure, or age &lt;18 or &gt;100 years) were removed to avoid skewing results with physiologically invalid data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After preprocessing, the dataset retained over 65,000 rows. This ensured that the analysis reflected realistic clinical patterns while removing noise that could otherwise distort the findings.</p>

      <h2>Data Understanding / Visualization</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>After preprocessing, the dataset contained over 65,000 patient records with a balanced mix of clinical, lifestyle, and demographic features. To better understand the data and connect it back to my main question, which modifiable lifestyle factors are most associated with cardiovascular disease, I began by examining the distributions of key variables and their relationships to the target.</p>
        <p>The derived variables behaved as expected. Age in years showed a wide distribution from young adults into the 70s and beyond, with most patients between 40 and 65 years old. BMI followed a bell-shaped curve centered around 25–30, indicating that overweight and obesity are common in this sample. Pulse pressure clustered around 40–50 mmHg, which is within the typical healthy range, though a noticeable tail of elevated values suggests a subset of patients with stiffer arteries or uncontrolled blood pressure. These distributions confirm that the dataset reflects realistic clinical patterns.</p>
        <p>Turning to lifestyle factors, I used bar charts to compare the prevalence of cardiovascular disease across alcohol use, smoking, and physical activity groups. Each bar was labeled with both the percentage of patients with CVD and the sample size, to avoid over-interpreting small categories. Interestingly, cardiovascular prevalence was only slightly higher among drinkers compared to non-drinkers, and the same pattern was seen for smokers versus non-smokers. By contrast, physical activity showed a clearer protective effect: inactive patients had a noticeably higher rate of CVD compared to those who reported being physically active.</p>
        <p>I also explored interactions between lifestyle factors. Two-way plots showed how combinations such as alcohol + smoking or alcohol + activity related to disease prevalence. For example, patients who both smoked and drank tended to have the highest CVD rates, while those who were active non-drinkers showed the lowest. However, sample size graphs revealed that some combinations (such as active drinkers who also smoke) were relatively rare in the dataset, making it important to interpret those results cautiously.</p>
        <p>Finally, I checked the overall class balance of the target variable. Cardiovascular disease was present in roughly half the sample, which means the dataset is not severely imbalanced. This balance is useful because it reduces the need for aggressive resampling or weighting during modeling. Together, these visualizations provided an important first look at the data and suggested that physical activity may have a stronger relationship with cardiovascular outcomes than alcohol or smoking alone, while also highlighting the need for careful interpretation of small subgroups.</p>

      <h2>Storytelling</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>At the beginning of this project, I was excited to work with a dataset that looked large, clean, and straightforward. With 70,000 rows and clearly labeled features, it seemed like an excellent choice for a first data mining project. I chose it with the hope of telling a focused story: that alcohol use, as a modifiable lifestyle choice, would show a clear link to cardiovascular health.</p>
        <p>As I dug deeper, though, I realized the dataset was not as ideal as it appeared. Alcohol use was recorded only as a binary variable (0 = no, 1 = yes), which collapsed a complex behavior into an oversimplified measure. There was no way to separate occasional social drinkers from heavy daily drinkers. To complicate matters further, most participants reported not drinking at all, leaving the drinking group relatively small. When I visualized the results, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease among drinkers and non-drinkers looked almost identical.</p>
        <p>This was initially frustrating, as it meant my original research question could not be answered with the nuance I intended. But it also became a valuable lesson in the realities of data science: datasets rarely align perfectly with expectations. Rather than abandoning the project, I broadened my scope to include other modifiable behaviors such as smoking, physical activity, and weight-related measures. This shift uncovered clearer patterns, especially around physical activity, which consistently showed protective effects against cardiovascular disease.</p>
        <p>The story I tell, then, is not only about lifestyle and health but also about the research process itself. Data can surprise us, and sometimes the most important outcome is learning to adapt our questions to what the dataset can realistically support.</p>

    <section id="impact">
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>This project demonstrates both the potential and the limitations of using health datasets to study lifestyle risk factors. On the positive side, it provided valuable academic experience in the full data mining pipeline process, including preprocessing, visualization, and critical reflection. It also reinforced the importance of modifiable factors like physical activity and weight management, which consistently appeared more predictive of cardiovascular outcomes than alcohol or smoking in this dataset. These insights, even if limited, can help raise awareness of behaviors that individuals can control to lower their risk of heart disease.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there are clear risks if the findings are misinterpreted. The binary alcohol variable reduces a complex behavior to yes/no, which could mislead readers into thinking that alcohol has no relationship with cardiovascular health. Similarly, focusing solely on lifestyle risks ignoring the significant roles of genetics, environment, stress, and access to healthcare. Because the data is observational and cross-sectional, it can only show correlations to cardiovascular disease, not prove causation. Overstating the results could unfairly stigmatize individuals or give false confidence about lifestyle changes.</p>
        <p>The dataset also leaves out important perspectives. It does not include information on diet, mental health, or socioeconomic status, all of which strongly influence cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, the data comes from a specific regional population in Eastern Europe, which limits its generalizability to other countries or cultures.</p>
        <p>In the end, the impact of this project lies in its balance. It shows how data mining can reveal meaningful patterns about health behaviors, but also underscores the responsibility to frame findings carefully. With thoughtful interpretation, this type of work can both improve technical skills and contribute to conversations about public health, while reminding us that no single dataset tells the full story.</p>
